 1. Understanding the Nature of Conflict
Conflict in the workplace is not only unavoidable but often necessary; if there are no conflicts, it may indicate that important conversations are being missed. To effectively resolve these issues, one must first categorise the type of conflict at hand:
• Technical Conflicts: These involve disagreements over project scope, implementation details, or timelines. These are often the easiest to resolve through logic and reasoning.
• Resource and Priority Conflicts: Common in corporate settings, these arise from constraints where trade-offs must be made. Resolving these requires asking the right questions to understand where pushback is coming from.
• People Conflicts: Often the hardest to resolve, these involve personal tensions, strong opinions, and emotional reactions.
• Healthy vs. Unhealthy Conflict: Healthy conflicts are debates where different perspectives lead to better ideas. Unhealthy conflicts are often emotional or manifested as "silence conflicts," where people stop responding entirely.

2. Core Resolution Strategies
The sources highlight several practical frameworks and tactics for navigating these challenges:
• The "Behavior, Impact, and Change" Framework: Focus on the facts rather than accusations or emotions. Identify the specific behaviours or opinions causing conflict, the impact they have on the parties involved, and what can be done differently to change the outcome.
• Data-Driven Resolution: Use data and facts as a primary strategy to question the necessity of certain processes or to find common ground.
• The Power of One-on-Ones: Avoid trying to drive alignment in large, heated meetings. Instead, use private settings to help stakeholders understand your perspective and to listen to their concerns without the pressure of an audience.
• Pre-meeting Alignment (Lobbying): To avoid "risky" conflicts in big meetings, pull key stakeholders aside beforehand to collect informal feedback and incorporate their concerns into your proposal. This builds relationships and ensures you have allies in the room.
• Radical Candor: This approach involves challenging directly while caring personally. A useful opening is: "I hear what you say and respect it, but I have a slightly different opinion".
• Strategic Annoyance: In some cases, it is beneficial to "initiate" conflict by being annoying at an appropriate time to surface a problem for broader discussion, eventually turning it into a growth opportunity.

3. De-escalation and Managing Emotions
When emotions run high, logic often fails. The panellists suggest several ways to de-escalate:
• The "No But" Rule: When someone is angry, acknowledge their feelings fully: "I would be frustrated if I were you. Full stop.". Avoid saying "but," as it cancels out the agreement and restarts the argument.
• Take a Pause: If you are too emotional to articulate facts, it is professional to walk away, take a deep breath, or even take the afternoon off to regroup.
• Deferred Response: Avoid responding to "spicy" emails or Slack messages at night when emotions are higher. Wait until the morning to provide a more logical response.
• Professional Distancing: View yourself as a "professional advisor" (like a doctor or lawyer) to remove personal ego from the situation.

4. Personal Experiences: Lessons from the Field
The guests shared specific instances where they applied these strategies:
• Navigating Leadership Attacks: Rachel recalled a meeting where a peer manager attacked her leadership style in front of her report. Instead of reacting impulsively while her "brain was frozen," she later scheduled a private call with that manager. She explained why his forum was inappropriate, and they eventually talked it out.
• Pushing Back for Growth: One guest shared how she disagreed with leadership's decision to move a high performer out of her team. Although the move happened, her pushback surfaced her team's need for growth, which eventually led to her receiving a higher-scope project that leadership cared about.
• Managing Up and Down: For managers, it is important to provide a "safe time" in one-on-ones for reports to share struggles, while maintaining a clear boundary so their emotions do not impact your own stability.

5. Cultural and Gender Considerations
As Asian women in North America, many guests noted that cultural expectations of harmony can lead to becoming a "yes man" or staying silent to avoid conflict. However, they emphasised that you must define your own leadership style rather than trying to mimic others.
One panellist noted that she eventually "gave up" on worrying about her English grammar mistakes in order to focus on getting her point across and earning credibility through her decisions. Ultimately, resolving conflict as an Asian woman often involves stepping out of the comfort zone of being "student-like" and becoming more vocal and brave in sharing perspectives.

Analogy for Understanding Conflict Resolution: Resolving a workplace conflict is like navigating a ship through a storm. You cannot stop the storm from happening, but you can choose not to steer directly into the lightning (the emotional triggers). Instead of shouting at the waves, you consult your charts (the data), talk privately with your crew (the 1-on-1s), and sometimes you simply have to drop anchor and wait for the morning light (taking a pause) before you can find the clear path forward.
